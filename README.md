## Description

Dynamic Time Scan Forecasting (DTSF) is a forecasting methodology that has been evaluated and validated using M4 competition data. This repository provides a complete implementation of the DTSF method and experimental configurations that allow you to reproduce the results discussed in the paper, offering a benchmark for time series forecasting.

### Key Features

- Complete implementation of the DTSF model.
- Data preprocessing and preparation tools for the M4 competition dataset.
- Benchmarking and comparative performance evaluation on M4 competition data.
